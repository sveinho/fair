REP submissions come in a wide variety of forms, not all adhering
to the format guidelines set forth below.  Use this template, in
conjunction with the format guidelines below, to ensure that your
REP submission won't get automatically rejected because of form.

ReStructuredText is offered as an alternative to plaintext REPs, to
allow REP authors more functionality and expressivity, while
maintaining easy readability in the source text.  The processed HTML
form makes the functionality accessible to readers: live hyperlinks,
styled text, tables, images, and automatic tables of contents, among
other advantages.  For an example of a REP marked up with
reStructuredText, see REP 287.
