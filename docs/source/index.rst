Intro
=====
This REP provides a boilerplate or sample template for creating your
own reStructuredText REPs.  In conjunction with the content guidelines
in REP 1 [1]_, this should make it easy for you to conform your own
REPs to the format outlined below.

Note: if you are reading this REP via the web, you should first grab
the text (reStructuredText) source of this REP in order to complete
the steps below.  **DO NOT USE THE HTML FILE AS YOUR TEMPLATE!**

To get the source this (or any) REP, look at the top of the HTML page
and click on the date & time on the "Last-Modified" line.  It is a
link to the source text in the ROS repository.

If you would prefer not to use markup in your REP, please see REP 9,
"Sample Plaintext REP Template" [2]_.

This template is entirely based on the PEP 9 template by David Goodger
and Barry Warsaw.  The Author field of this document has been changed
in order to reflect reponsibility for maintenance.
